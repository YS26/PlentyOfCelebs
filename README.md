# PlentyOfCelebs
For my CIS 112 Data Structures and Algorithm class, I made a simple fun dating app that utilizes data structure 
algorithms to match the user with a celebrity. The application works similar to modern day dating apps 
such as PlentyOfFish or OkCupid. The user selects their gender, year of birth, and chooses a few interests. 
After the user has chosen their three favorite interests, the user will match with a celebrity based on their 
selected interests along with the celebrityâ€™s picture. From there the user can keep on generating all 
his or her possible matches. Additionally, if the user wants to see their previous matches they have the option to do so. 
This simple fun program uses the following data structures ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, Priority Queue, and Stacks. 

Running the program: 
I highly recommend using Eclipse to run the program, I had some issues with Jgrasp, 
and Intellij on loading up the celebrity images.
